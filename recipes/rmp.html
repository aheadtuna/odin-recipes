      alt="Roasted Melting Potatoes">
      <p>You’ll toss the potatoes in the butter 
       mixture before baking them at a high temperature until golden brown. The final step involves adding vegetable broth and garlic to the pan and roasting until the 
       potatoes are tender. </p>
      <p>The result is potatoes with a creamy interior and lightly crisp exterior that perfectly complement any main dish (though they’re impressive on their own, too). You can garnish them with fresh herbs before serving, but they may disappear so quickly that you won’t 
      even have time to admire the decorative result. </p>
