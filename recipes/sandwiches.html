                <p>Preheat the oven and prepare a baking sheet:</p>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 425Â°F with a rack in the upper third of the oven. Place the butter on a rimmed 
                baking sheet and place in the preheated oven until the butter melts, about 5 minutes.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Assemble the sandwiches and bake:</p>
                <p>Spread goat cheese evenly on 5 of the bread slices.</p>
                <p>Carefully tilt the pan so the melted butter coats the bottom. Arrange all of the bread slices in a single 
                layer in the melted butter on the baking sheet. Ensure the goat cheese is facing up.</p>
                <p>Place 1 cheddar slice on each bread slice with goat cheese 
                and place 1 slice each of provolone and 1 slice of Swiss on each plain bread slice.</p>
