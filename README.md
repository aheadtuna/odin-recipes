# odin-recipes
This Project is just an exercise for me to learn basic html.

In this project i utilized unordered and ordered lists such has headings paragraphs
ans boilerplate html. I used a resource in the web which is called the odin project.
It is very good for web development but just only for that and that is not bad no no
no it is the opposite. 

But to be clear ... Today i learned a lot. I learned things you can not describe because you only achieve them if you CODE! But i can not go on because i am tired and i will hit the sack.
